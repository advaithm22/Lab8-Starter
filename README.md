## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation embraces the concept of working downwards in a user-focused manner. With regards to a web-app, this means handling scenarious where the network capabilities are poor and may not be up to the speed we desire. Moreover, it could entail the process of storing everything in a central place with the assistance of a feature capable of retrieving data during events where fetching info from network could be problematic. This is where service workers come into play. Service workers are able to operate outside of the web app so that they can listen to any requests made to the network. This handles worst case scenarios such as poor network connectivity and speed. In the case of web apps, this allows for graceful degradation to be practiced fully, as we are focusing on the user and any issues that can arise when they use the app.
